# heapsort-java-demo
Java based animated demonstration of Heap Sort algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here an animated demonstration of Heap Sort algorithm running on HTML5 Canvas. Here the Heap Sort algorithm itself is implemented in Java on server side. Javascript is used for display and initialization only. The communication between browser and server is implemented as an AJAX POST request.

For a Javascript only implementation please visit this repository:
